# 🔨 Nail: The Programming Language for Grug Brain Devs

Welcome to Nail - the programming language so simple, it's genius. Inspired by the wisdom of [grugbrain.dev](https://www.grugbrain.dev).

More detailed info the [Nail Language Spec](nail_language_spec.md).

## 🚀 Why Nail? Because Complexity Bad. Very Bad.

- **Linux Only:** Nail no like cross-platform headache. Linux only.
- **Rust Power:** Nail built on Rust. Fast, safe.
- **Magic Behind Scenes:** Concurrency, async? Nail handle. You write logic.
- **One IDE:** Vim-like, in terminal. Only IDE you need.
- **No Package Nightmares:** Everything comes in box. No "works on my machine".
- **No Imports:** Just use stuff. No more import hell.

## 🎭 Features Grug Love:

- **Everything Immutable:** No accidental changes. Clean, simple.
- **Pattern Matching:** `if` statements old news. `match` is way.
- **Good Parts of Functional:** Map, filter, reduce. No loops.
- **No OOP:** OOP make brain hurt. Nail keep it simple.
- **Smart Error Handling:** Errors bubble up, adding context. Result type best type.
- **Simple Structs:** Structs can contain other structs. Keep nesting shallow, grug brain happy.
- **Simple Garbage Collection:** No manual memory management. Grug no like.

## 🏗️ Current State: Baby Nail

Nail very new. Big dreams, small code:

- **Core Language:** Basic stuff work.
- **Parser:** Grugs working on it!
- **Transpiler:** Grugs also working on it!
- **IDE:** Have terminal, will code badly.
- **Standard Library:** Need talk to Rust first (FFI maybe?)

## 🤔 Who Nail For?

- Grug brain devs who think modern programming too complex
- Rust lovers who want chill time
- Python fans who want speed
- JavaScript devs who want to fix life mistakes
- New devs who like simple things
- Experienced devs who like simple things
- Medium skill devs will hate it and post about it on Reddit and Hacker News. Is okay.
