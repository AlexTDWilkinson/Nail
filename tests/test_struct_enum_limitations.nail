// Test to document current limitations of struct/enum support
// Currently supported: Declaration only
// Not yet supported: Instantiation, field access, pattern matching

// These declarations work:
struct User {
    username:s,
    user_id:i,
    is_admin:b
}

enum Status {
    Active,
    Inactive,
    Pending,
    Suspended
}

// This works - basic types and operations
message:s = `Structs and enums can be declared`;
count:i = 42;

// These would NOT work (commented out):
//new_user:User = User { username: `Alice`, user_id: 1, is_admin: false };
//status:Status = Status::Active;
// print(new_user.username);
// match status { ... }

print(message);
