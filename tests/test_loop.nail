// Test that loop syntax parses correctly
// Note: In Nail, variables are immutable, so we can't have traditional counters
// This test just verifies the loop/break/continue syntax works

// Simple loop with immediate break
loop {
    print(`Loop iteration`);
    break;
}

// Loop demonstrating that external values can be accessed
value:i = 5;
loop {
    print(string_from(value));
    print(`Breaking loop`);
    break;
}

// Note: continue without break would create infinite loop
// since we can't mutate variables to change loop conditions

print(`Loop tests completed`);
